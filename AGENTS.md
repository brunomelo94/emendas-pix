# Project Agents.md Guide for OpenAI Codex

This Agents.md file provides comprehensive guidance for OpenAI Codex and other AI agents working with this codebase.

## Project overview

**Title:** Special transfers (“Emendas PIX”) and municipal electoral performance in 2024: a multilevel approach

**Background:**  
Introduced by Constitutional Amendment 105/2019, “Emendas PIX” are mandatory, rapid federal transfers that deputies allocate directly to municipalities. In 2024, these transfers totaled R$ 4 billion (part of R$ 28.8 billion in federal voluntary transfers), raising questions about transparency, clientelism, and the political criteria behind budget allocations.

**Objective:**  
Assess whether the per-capita volume of “Emendas PIX” allocated by federal deputies is associated with higher re-election probabilities or improved electoral performance of same-party mayors in the 2024 municipal elections.

**Data sources:**  
- **CGU / Transparency Portal:** Annual “Emendas PIX” amounts per municipality (2020–2024)  
- **TSE:** 2024 municipal election results and re-election status  
- **IBGE:** Socio-economic indicators by municipality (IDHM, GDP per capita, population density, schooling rate)

**Methodology:**  
1. **Data extraction & preprocessing:**
   – Load and clean datasets using Pandas and NumPy  
2. **Exploratory analysis & clustering:**  
   – Visualize distributions and correlations; apply k-means to group municipalities by socio-economic profiles  
3. **Multilevel modeling:**  
   – Build a stepwise hierarchical model (null model, random intercept, random slope, full model) to estimate the effect of PIX transfers per capita on electosral outcomes, controlling for party and socio-economic clusters  

**Tools & libraries:**  
Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn), scikit-learn, statsmodels, Pymer4

**Expected outcomes:**  
Identification of significant associations between “Emendas PIX” per capita and mayoral electoral performance, offering evidence on the political use of budget transfers and informing debates on transparency and clientelistic practices.  


## Project Structure for OpenAI Codex Navigation

- `/notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and exploration
- `/src`: Main source code directory, used to implement functions
- `/data`: Files that OpenAI Codex should use fore reference

## Coding Conventions for OpenAI Codex

### General Conventions for Agents.md Implementation

- Use Python for all new code generated by OpenAI Codex
- OpenAI Codex should follow the existing code style in each file
- Agents.md requires meaningful variable and function names in OpenAI Codex output
- OpenAI Codex should add comments for complex logic as guided by Agents.md

## Pull Request Guidelines for OpenAI Codex

When OpenAI Codex helps create a PR, please ensure it:

1. Includes a clear description of the changes as guided by Agents.md
2. References any related issues that OpenAI Codex is addressing

All checks must pass before OpenAI Codex generated code can be merged. Agents.md helps ensure OpenAI Codex follows these requirements.
